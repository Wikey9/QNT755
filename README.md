Project Details 

1.	For our project, we used a dataset from Kaggle that contains statistics on trending YouTube videos. The zip file contains multiple CSV files for different global regions, of which we used Canada, Great Britain, and the United States. You can download and find more information about the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new

2.	We combined the 3 .csv files for CA, GB and US and answered the following questions:
    a.	Top 10 days with the most views overall
    b.  Top 10 days in December 2017 with the most views
    c.  Top 5 videos with the most views
    d.  What portion of total views does each country have?
    e.  Views & Likes by month for 2018 (January – June) - visualization
    f.  Title of the video with the most views from each country
    g.	Title of the video with the most likes overall

3.	Machine learning Analysis – Decision Tree classifier model and k-means clustering
    a.	Similar k-means clustering code/analysis found on Kaggle
       i.	Using the USvideos.csv data only, they first looked at the frequency of each category ID, then analyzed the correlation between likes and comments and likes
       and dislikes, which were both positive. Next, they used k-means clustering with 5 clusters based on likes, views, and comments. You can find more information on
