Draft (for README file with our Github project URL) - Project Details 
1.	We used a dataset from Kaggle of trending youtube video statistics. The zip file contained multiple CSV files for different regions, of which we used Canada, Great Britain, and the United States. You can find more information about the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new?select=USvideos.csv 
2.	We combined the 3 .csv files for CA, GB and US and answered the following questions:
a.	The video with the most views from each of the 3 regions
b.	The video with the most likes overall
3.	Machine learning
a.	Analysis â€“ k-means clustering & Decision Tree classifier model
b.	Similar k-means clustering code/analysis found on Kaggle
i.	Using the USvideos.csv data only, they first looked at the frequency of each category ID, then analyzed the correlation between likes and comments and likes and dislikes, which were both positive. Next, they used k-means clustering with 5 clusters based on likes, views, and comments.
